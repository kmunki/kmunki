# Culture #1: Of Human Slop

Jurassic Park World is human slop. That is, I admit, a gross thing to describe anything as, but the shoe squelchingly fits. But if you’re worried about AI harming creatives, you must reckon with this movie.

“Slop” is the current pejorative for the semi-comprehensible content created by AI that LARPs as a real news article, LinkedIn post, or TikTok influencer. Slop is a catch-all that combines lazy, bland, manufactured, generic, and subtly incoherent content with a sixth finger still in the uncanny valley. It is the Facebook post with American flag kittens that your Aunt likes. Some would compare it to ultra-processed food, but at least Twinkies and Doritos taste good. Slop is whatever it is they put in gas station supplements.

Yes, Jurassic Park World is the film equivalent of the ED pills next to the hotdogs on rollers. I wish it was horrible. I wish it was an over-the-top disaster with chaotic casting and bizarre narrative and glitchy special effects. I wish there were cartoonish lines of dialogue, scene chewing acting, absurd breaks in continuity, anything to show that humans worked on this thing and made some mistakes.

But it is not that. Jurassic Park World opens with an extremely high-tech facility being ruined by a candy wrapper. This is not shout-at-the-screen frustrating like the “I'm particularly bad at the thing I’m specially trained in” issues of Prometheus. No, no, that is, at least, interesting to watch. Instead, the candy wrapper explains the entire film. You will be able to predict every single detail of this film, it tells you. Oh, I’m sorry, no, it shows you. In an extremely advanced lab, where everyone is clearly at the top of their game as they are better than the original Jurassic Park scientists and have learned from their foolishness and take all manner of precautions, a bumbling top scientist bumbles open his snickers bar and bumbles the wrapper onto the ground. It is the only piece of debris in the entire gigantic lab. It is in the middle of a highly visible floor where multiple people are preparing to go into the cell of a huge mutant D-Rex—

What? Oh? Why are they going in there?

Well you see… oh… hmmm. So there are three scientists, and they need to very carefully work together to open this door because it’s so secure and dangerous, because there is a dinosaur in there. Well not just any dinosaur. A mutant hybrid, the D-rex, which I assume stands for Dinosaurus Rex. They have to go in there to—is it check on the dinosaur?

It doesn’t matter. Already, two minutes into the film, it is telegraphing to you precisely what will happen. 

I want you to rewatch the opening of Jurassic Park. Jurassic Park is iconic and, as will be explained in later posts, Iconic. 

The opening misdirects you multiple times. Note how even if you have scene it, you likely forgot exactly how it happens. I searched for it knowing what it was for this post, knowing the scene was called “Shoot her!” and I forgot exactly when things go wrong, how, and to whom. You could teach a class just on this sequence (it introduces Muldoon, tells you about what type of person he is in this moment, and also the type that would keep working at the park after this. It tells you about that the people running the park are prepared, well staffed, well funded and still underestimate the danger. They try to protect their asset and only kill it as a last resort, after it has already killed. You know that they do not stop even though someone dies. You get the entire film in a microcosm in the first scene.

You learn this subconsciously. You are keyed up, this image echoing in your head for the first full act of the movie—and even then the subsequent reveals aren’t this threat (first dinos are herbivores, then T-rex, etc).

The opening from Rebirth is, however, instantly predictable. Within less than fifteen seconds of the opening of the film, you know that the image at the top of this post with is exactly how the scene will end. You know that the first person we see, the bumbling scientist eating candy, will be the person it happens to, and that his candy bar will be the cause. You feel no fear or excitement as they open the paddock door. You do not gasp as the wrapper is sucked into a vent on a door that causes it to short circuit. You do not thrill as alarms go off. You sit back in your seat as the D-rex, which you have seen on the merch, on the posters, and in the trailers, emerges. 

As it does, instead of being gripped in the moment, you are realizing how the whole film will go. You already know it shows up at the end of the film. You remember other Jurassic Park films and think, oh will probably bite something out of the sky. You understand, intuitively, that it will eat the worst person in the film. You are instantly aware will not harm anyone the film wants you to like, such as the children or Scarjo or any of the unnamed characters from early in the film.

And this is just the plot of the film. The acting is bizarre, with hardened mercenaries who’ve lost friends and loved ones just joshing around and running petty cons on billionaires. Both of the named mercenaries, played by the actors who you’ve heard of, are sweet and instantly likable and jovial, despite being soldiers of fortune who are famous for breaking laws and killing people on the dime of the highest bidder. They talk about their sad pasts, laughing mere moments later, as if the scenes were filmed out of order and then just left that way. The mercenaries who die are unnamed and do not have personalities, nor do they seem to have ever been mercenaries. We learn early in the film that the water dinosaurs will capsize a ship, but give up the second the nice family is out of the water. Whereas when they are shot at and dealing with a larger, steel hulled, diesel powered engine, they will attack.

Also there is apparently a Mayan temple of some kind on the island?

I could go on, but the critical piece here is that hundreds of people worked on this. Several of them were talented actors. The director, Gareth Edwards, made Rogue One. Spielberg is an executive producer on this movie. It got to use the original score and had the same screenwriter. It has constant (pathetic, joyless) call backs to the original film. This was not a film made by idiots or by terrible corporate meddling or hiring the wrong people. 

But it is slop.

If you told me Jurassic World Rebirth was the first movie written, directed, and generated by AI, I would believe you. It is everything creatives are worried about and it is being done by people. Not just any people! Talented people with track records of not doing this. Scarlett Johansson was in Under the Skin, and Lost In Translation, and is in Wes Anderson movies! Mahershala Ali was in Moonlight and True Detective and House of Cards when it was good! Johnathan Bailey even seems… fine? 

And yet every single one of them was involved in something so bland and insipid as to make me question each and every one of their humanity. Now, you can tell yourself “well these movies are for the international market” or “it’s a blatant cash grab” and maybe it is. That the live action Lilo & Stitch was panned but has grossed almost a billion world wide does argue in favor of that. But really? You think everyone involved just happily shipped a turd?

If you’re a rabid defender of artists, this puts you in a bad position. AI is not a key part of the industry, and certainly wasn’t in the creation of Rebirth. It’s just obvious Hollywood dreck. But dreck made by, by all evidence, very talented human artists. They chose to do this! Without AI! All of these wooden, bland choices were made by people who all know better.
