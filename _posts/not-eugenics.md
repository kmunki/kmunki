# Bioethics #2: Not Eugenics
Second bioethics post and the big E already dropped.

In his recent interview with George Church, Dwarkesh asked about an ‘underhyped’ technology. Church landed on genetic counseling, but articulated it in a way I had never heard before. Church, in the gentlest of terms, sets out facts that make our collective hesitation around genetic counseling seem at a minimum short-sighted, but really a kind of moral failing. I’m quoting it here in full because Church’s point is easy to take out of context and I think the lucidity of how his answer builds deserves to be heard in full. Emphasis mine.

What I would say is genetic counseling is underhyped. It is clearly competitive with gene therapy in a certain sense, clearly not for people that are already born but for people in the future, not even distant future but in the next couple of years. We've got a chance of diagnosing them or diagnosing the potential parents and dodging… This has been in practice since 1985 in Dor Yeshorim, a perfectly reasonable community response to it. It eliminated or greatly reduced all sorts of very serious inherited diseases.

Sometimes, depending on how it's presented, it’s dismissed as eugenics. Rarely have I heard Dor Yeshorim described that way and rightly so. What they're doing is standard medicine whether you cure these kids as soon as they are newborns or whether you counsel the parents so the same disease is missing. The problem with eugenics was that it was forced. The government forced it on people. It wasn't that it enabled people to make a choice. It's that it removed the choice from the people. That was what was wrong. And that's the confusion.

But I don't think that's the explanation for why this is underhyped. I think it's because when people are dating, they're not thinking about reproduction necessarily. And when they're thinking about reproduction, they're not necessarily thinking about serious genetic diseases because they're rare. I think it's our difficulty with dealing with rare things.

There was great resistance to seat belts because less than 1% of people died in automobile accidents or even got hurt. There was great resistance to stopping smoking. It's hard even for us to imagine how great the resistance was for seat belts and smoking. But eventually we got over it.

I think this is a similar thing. Only 3% of children are severely affected by genetic diseases and they feel like, “I'm not that unlucky. I'm in the 97%.” If those were your odds of winning at the horse races or at the casino, you'd take them. 97% of winning, good. But when a child's future is at risk, I think that's not the right solution.

The other thing is that I think it has to do with the trolley problem. If you don't influence it, it's not your fault. But actually everything is your fault. Not doing something is a decision. So I think it's like, “If I just don't do anything and they come out damaged, it's not my fault”, but it is.

This nearly blew my AirPods out of my ears. Church does three things very, very well here. First, he kneecaps any attempt at claiming he’s arguing for eugenics when he talks about genetic counseling. Genetic counseling is a choice based in well understood science, eugenics is not. Second, he introduces an analogy that is hard to argue with and is apolitical. It me of Alex Tabarrok’s critique of the WHO for delaying the malaria vaccine, but is directly focused on American decisions that we all are collectively fine with. Third, he basically makes Savulescu’s procreative beneficence argument in a few sentences.

He does all of this in a casual, lucid style that makes it all sound mundane. But his claim is radical. 

Restated, Church is saying something along the lines of, “Millions of children and people suffer because we are uncomfortable with genetic counseling being anything like eugenics. But it’s not. Eugenics was forced, counseling is a choice. There was  resistance to adding seat belts and stopping smoking, but we all agree that was the right thing to do, and both of those affected fewer people less often. Rolling the dice with nature is a choice, and that choice increases the risk of preventable suffering.”

Where I think Church’s analogy breaks a little bit is that, well, the government forced people to wear seat belts and not smoke. This puts his argument in a bit of an awkward position. But his use of percentages of risk has another, even better analogy, that directly applies to the topic of choice—pregnancy.

The data vary, but most women tend to avoid or cutback on ‘risky’ things during pregnancy, such as caffeine, alcohol, sushi, deli meats, and so on, to reduce the risk of complications. Asking a woman who is already dealing with the trials of pregnancy to also completely give up things she enjoys is not a trivial ask. Yet, particularly in the US, there is a great deal of guilt and fear around doing these things while pregnant, even though the net gain is something like reducing the defect rate from 1 in 33 (which Church cites) to something like 1 in 36. Emily Oster’s Expecting Better has a great breakdown of how all various pieces add up (or don’t).

Thus, the implicit question: If a women is willing to give up several of life’s little pleasures for a 0.3 percentage point reduction in risk, why wouldn’t she be willing to do genetic counseling for a full percentage point, or more? Turns out, they are!

About 80% of women opt for genetic counseling in the US (the n here is crummy, but this doesn’t buck intuition). Genetic counseling is usually fully covered by insurance and when it isn’t, it’s a couple hundred bucks. Counseling is purely descriptive, giving parents information about their situation, but no prescriptive guidance on what to do with the information.

When Church says genetic screening and counseling are ‘underhyped’ I interpret that as, we have under invested in it. Women are opting to get the counseling available, but a lot of that counseling and testing is pretty mediocre, and there aren’t billions of dollars pouring into it. This is out of sync with the amount of good counseling can do, let alone more robust ARTs like PGT + IVF. Now, Church sits on the board of Orchid Biosciences, which very much does see the potential here. Instead of just a handful of tests, Orchid is working on a huge range of tests, so that parents can be better informed.

And I can feel you starting to worry again. Isn’t this backdoor eugenics? Is the choice an illusion? Isn’t it going to be compelled by society? Or just available to the rich?

First, if you’re going to critique genetic counseling, you have to pick. You can worry that it’s bad and we’ll have to do it, or you can worry it’s good and some people won’t get to do it. You can’t worry about both simultaneously. The superposition of handwringing is just sparkling status quo bias and naturalistic fallacy. Yes, obscuring these sorts of logical traps using Very Serious Moral Language is a special skill of the current bioethics community, but I will not be fooled.

Is this backdoor eugenics? No. Eugenics is a centrally organized and imposed method of deciding who gets to reproduce. Church’s point, eugenics is forced by the government, is key. If it’s optional, it’s not eugenics.

You might argue, “Well there is social pressure!” Sure, there is social pressure to do lots of things, like go to therapy or lift heavy objects, but that is extremely different from the government forcing you to do them or doing them to you against your will. If you think genetic counseling is bad, you needn’t do it.

If you think social pressure is just too coercive and that people are helpless drones so enough social pressure is tantamount to government imposition (yes, a lot of bioethicists argue this), I beg you to think for 30 additional seconds. 

Consider: there is already enormous pressure on mothers and parents to do quite a few things, which a huge number of them choose not to do. Take vaccines—whether or not you think they’re good (they are) there is a surprising amount of pressure in both directions that gets resisted. Millions of people get all the vaccines for their kids despite RFK Jr. being in charge and millions of people don’t do that despite every chart on Our World in Data existing. Every day people managed to choose to do what they want despite enormous social, governmental, and expert pressure to do so or not do so, especially when it comes to kids.

If you worry that it’ll be awesome and only rich people will get to do it, again, please, just consider the real world for a few minutes. GLP-1s are a borderline miracle drug, a shot that makes you lose weight with minimal side effects and maybe a ton of benefits? If I told you about this drug twenty years ago, every bioethicist would be wringing their hands about the haves and have nots and a new class of ectomorphs ruling over us. Only wealthy people will get this miracle drug! Thinness will become a status symbol. What about the rest of us?

Instead it’s the opposite—thinness and fitness were already status indicators! By the twenty teens, having a healthy BMI meant you had the time and resources to trail run or do CrossFit or whatever. Health signaled wealth. Who needs a lambo when your body fat was below average for your age range. Now a normal BMI  just means you have health insurance and can manage to use an autoinjector once a week. GLP-1s are probably going to break the correlation between BMI and socio economic status.

Genetic counseling is likely going to have some unexpected effects. As Henry Oliver notes, all technology is a Faustian pact. Phones are probably rotting our brains and the internet is making us all lonely. It also let me listen to an incredible interview with an amazing scientist done by an independent journalist for free. It’s letting me write this essay. We know genetic counseling will have problems and almost none of them will be the ones people are freaking out about. Most ethicists are extremely bad futurists (even, maybe especially, the EAs). Shouting “it’s eugenics” or vacillating between “what if we have to?” and “what if we don’t get to?” doesn’t help. 

Instead, ethicists should be thinking hard about What does good look like assuming this is optional, effective, and cheap? That’s a topic for another post. What I want to underline is that Church’s position is that the ethical thing is not to worry about the risks of genetic counseling, but to worry about the 3% of births with defects. We should not just accept that natural rate anymore than we would accept it if it was caused by binge drinking alcohol or not taking folic acid. Church is guiding us to look at technology as a means to a more moral future, where more children are born healthier. 

I am not arguing genetic counseling is going to lead to a perfect utopia, Church certainly isn’t. But it seems to be a good way to make things a bit better for a lot of people, living and not yet born. So yeah, maybe it does deserve a bit more hype.
