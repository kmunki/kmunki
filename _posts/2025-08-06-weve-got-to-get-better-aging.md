# Bioethics #1: We’ve got to get better about aging.

Study Head of an Old Man with a White Beard Anthony van Dyck Flemish ca. 1617–20

We accept that 18-year-olds aren't mature enough to rent cars, but we refuse to admit that 85-year-olds might not be sharp enough to run countries. Seems like that’s probably a mistake. We need age maximums. Or, at minimum, we need to get comfortable talking about them.

People with large platforms handwringing about our aging society seem unable to do this. After an [entire essay](https://www.slowboring.com/p/gerontocracy-is-everywhere) showing that leadership in important places (government, business, academia, science) is aging faster than the population, Ben Krauss at *Slow Boring* ended his post with:

> So are there any fixes?
> 
> The Age Discrimination in Employment Act rightly protects older workers. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t invest in programs that give younger scientists a fair shot at NIH funding, where they’re often overlooked. Other concrete policies to consider include reforming the tenure system to ensure senior academics remain intellectually productive as they continue to receive university support. More boardrooms could start implementing caps on terms. Age limits for politicians seem wrong-headed and anti-democratic, but reforms to make elections more competitive, and less likely to favor entrenched incumbents, are wise.

Similarly, at *Persuasion*, Frances Fukuyama [explains why a lot of old people is *bad*](https://www.persuasion.community/p/against-life-extension), but doesn’t recommend we do anything to fix it save not let people live even longer.

*Slow Boring* is a policy website. *Persuasion* is in that vein, and Fukuyama is a political science guy. This isn’t me asking for some policy ideas from philosophers or economists who are just articulating the problem. These are both people who want us to act on the problem, preferably via government. Make a suggestion guys!

Death, in the span of about 100 years, had changed. In 1910, there was no life-support. You died when your body gave up. In 2010, it was possible to, in effect, keep a corpse alive so that the organs remained as fresh as possible for donation. Someone in a vegetative state, with little or even no verifiable brain function (look up ‘hot nose sign’) had gone from something that just kind of happened to something that humans often had to do on purpose. 

Death still isn’t optional, but it often now, to varying degrees, requires some degree of *intentional choice*. Do Not Resuscitate and Do Not Intubate are common. More complex advance directives (no permanent tubes) are attempting to keep pace with all of the ostensibly wonderful, but vaguely ominous methods we have of keeping ourselves alive. These methods are, of course, only ominous in a particular scenario: when we are old.

Yes, age limits feel icky. Yet, intuitively, we all know age is a useful proxy. Medicare becomes available at 65 *for a reason*. People made that decision. Nearly all medical guidance has some age component to it. Why are we ok with age limits in this scenario? Why 65 and not 70? Or 60? It’s arbitrary, it’s hard to defend, it’s too broad a rule, and yet, it mostly works.

Age maximums are the *minimum* type of policy we should be exploring. That *or* we state, explicitly, that age ranges for policies are no longer appropriate and, instead, we will use some kind of objective test or other criteria. Driving, voting, drinking, military service, government service, car rental, would all be based on something else. Krauss and Fukuyama have got to face the fact that if an aging society is really, truly a concern, then we need a set of safety measures at the other end of life that protects society from the impacts.

We accept age minimums because we recognize a person’s brain literally finishes maturing through their teens and well into their 20s. We have an enormous amount of evidence that most people’s brain starts to struggle after 65 in minor ways and substantially after 75. Are there exceptions? Of course! But there are plenty for age minimums too! We all have met someone who probably could have been an effective president at 32. Alas.

But we have to get comfortable with the fact that being over 75 is akin to being under 25. The further from that number, the less capable you’re, on average, likely to be. We should either impose hard limits (can’t be president ‘till you’re 35) or at least begin forcing trade-offs (can’t get government healthcare of *any kind* if you violate an age maximum). None of this is agism anymore than age minimums are. We’re addressing how the basic facts of biology, in aggregate, affect our society.

We’re mastering the science of aging. It’s time to start mastering the politics of it as well.
