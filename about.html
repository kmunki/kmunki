    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kyle. I'm a product manager, writer, and bioethicist. I've been a product manager for almost a decade, with my most recent work launching <a href='https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-one-medical-launches-ai-tools-for-better-patient-care'>flagship AI products</a> at Amazon One Medical.</p>
    
    <p>I am also a regular contributor to <a href='https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/author/kmunkittrick'>3 Quarks Daily</a>, where I tend to write a lot about how technology and the humanities tend to be better and more interesting together.</p>
