    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kyle. I'm a writer and product manager interested in bioethics, AI, and literature. I've been a product manager for almost a decade. My most recent work was launching <a href='https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-one-medical-launches-ai-tools-for-better-patient-care'>flagship AI products</a> at Amazon One Medical. Before that, my team and I built tools and systems that helped make practice management easier (tasks, scheduling, check-in), improved safety with vaccine scanners (the first hardware at One Medical), and added lots of quality of life elements for our patients (like the 'running late' text option).</p>

    <h2>Current Work</h2>
    <p>I am a regular contributor to <a href='https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/author/kmunkittrick'>3 Quarks Daily</a>, where I tend to write a lot about how technology and the humanities tend to be better and more interesting together.</p>
    <p>Personal projects include creating an MCP to let Claude Code read and work with Scrivener so that I can have a team of agents help enhance my writing process and to see if AI can be a legitimate partner in creative work. I'll be exploring serialized publishing and how things like GitHub might allow self-publishing to be higher quality and more collaborative.</p>
