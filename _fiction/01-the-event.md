Eloise wakes to *chaos*. She *cannot* quite tell if she is even awake. The ship seems to be spinning and falling around her. Her hands shoot out, gripping the sides of the mattress, expecting the blanket and then herself to go flying off up to the ceiling. Outside her porthole looks like she is inside a shaken snow globe. She knows it isn’t snow, it can’t be, not out at sea in August. She is reminded of John Glenn in The Right Stuff seeing fireflies. The lights are flickering inside her cabin and she feels as if she is being tossed about, but everything in the room is still. She cannot lift herself off the bed, barely able to turn her head side to side, as if in a cyclotron. Every sense is assaulted. She smells burning metal and incense and petrichor and a sharp organic tang. She tastes blood, then sweet acid, like lemon, then she salivates wildly, ravenous, hungrier than she has ever been. The lights in the cabin flicker and when they go dark, other lights flicker in and out, as though the items in the room themselves were sparking or glowing. The ship groans and screams, as if being twisted into pieces. There are voices outside the door, first mumbling, then a cheering chorus, then the wailing of coyotes and the roar of the jungle, then quiet again.

For an instant, there is a man in the room. He is ancient, wizened. His brow is heavy, eyebrows thick, jaw set. He wears a huge thin but well combed and trimmed beard. On his huge caveman brow sits a terrifying crown. It looks less like a circlet but instead reminds her of the jaws of a shark, opened to full circle, as though he ate with golden teeth from the top of his head. He nods at her, slightly, in greeting, revealing rows of teeth within the crown, like that of a lamprey. His vestitures are regal and ragged in the same moment. They seem to writhe, as if he is in a current of wind or suspended in water. He is not ethereal or see through, he is fully there, in the room, and looking right at her. She cannot move, remains pinned. The flashes of light flicker around him, illuminating him in different ways. He is leaning on a staff, a great cluster of rock and glass affixed to its top. In his hand he holds something she cannot identify. It glows of its own light and horrifies her.

He is gone.

The sound, tastes, and smells creschendo. Eloise feels as though she is being crushed and floating away and drowning all at once.

Then stillness and silence.

She rolls over and vomits.

Her ears and senses are ringing, but it’s like a memory of those feelings. They are doing it out of habit. She stumbles into the bathroom. She splashes water on her face. In the mirror she sees herself, but almost in caricature. She is old, and hardened, a bitter, savage woman. She stumbles backwards. She opens the door to her stateroom, expecting the storm she heard, but it is quiet, still. A gust of wind hits her — it’s cold. She dresses haphazardly and stumbles out to the next room, Maya’s. She raises her hand to knock and the door is whipped open.

Maya is there, grinning ear to ear.

What, she asks, do you recon happened? Did you feel it too?

What was it?

No idea!

Together the two encounter the scientists. They’re already half-outfitted with their equipment, but seem equally disoriented. It’s hard to tell, but some part of them seemed to know this was coming. They seem oddly excited as well. Terrified, unlike Maya, who seems to be in a state of pure elation. Eloise is confounded by this and also furious that their delusions are driving them. She makes fun of them for being Ghostbusters with stupid gear. One of the scientists notes that the Ghostbusters were right. That’s the plot of the movie. A crew member finds them and summons them all to the bridge.

In the bridge they are greeted by the captain and about half the crew. D’elarious is still filming, but is running into issues uploading. His stream is being watched but all the reactions are strange. He is narrating his experience, which Eloise finds different but similar.

Missing, of course, are Rand, Shruti, and Jane, as well as half the crew—the ‘new crew’ members. Agatha is surprisingly calm - she doesn’t know what happened anymore than anyone else, but knows better than to panic. Her equipment is showing strange information, but it is working.

The scientists demand to go onto the roof of the con. Agatha says the search is more important, what if they’ve gone over board. One of the scientists simply starts going up. Eloise intervenes with Agatha — let them go up, we’ll organize search parties. Whatever is happening is extremely strange and they all know it. Agatha explains the search plan. They’ll go in groups of three, one crew for every two guests. Search patterns are shared. Guesses as to where they are are discussed. Maybe checking on their gear, maybe in their state rooms, maybe got into a life raft. Hard to say. The groups will search systematically. Walkies are handed out.
